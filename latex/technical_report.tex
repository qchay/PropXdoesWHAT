\section{Motivation}

We want to help users become aware of laws that affect them personally, particularly those in traditionally underrepresented groups. 
Since many laws can have complex side effects, due to both complexity in their primary purpose and the unfortunately common practice of including unrelated changes as riders, it can be difficult to keep up with legislation being worked on or voted on that could impact your life.
Marginalized groups especially can find changes that affect programs they may rely on buried in otherwise innocuous laws, or be unsure of what groups may be able to advocate for them or help them navigate changes.
Our goal is to allow groups to see what recent and upcoming laws may impact them and from there find groups which can better inform them and provide routes to take action against those which would harm them.


\section{User Stories}

The following are the initial user stories gathered for Phase 1: \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item As a user, I want to be able to identify which groups are impacted by a law.
	\item As a user, I want to see what congressmen, senators, city-council, etc. are supporting a law.
	\item As a user, I want to be able to compare advocacy groups.
	\item As a user, I want to see where the politicians lie on the political spectrum.
	\item As a user, I want to see the implications of a law.
	\item As a user, I want to know how I can to contact my senator/representative.
\end{itemize}
